# About Me

Welcome to my world of technology, learning, and adventure!

Hello, and thank you for taking the time to explore my journey! I’m a 40-year-old with a passion that spans from my first steps into the fascinating world of computers to delving into the nuances of cognitive neuroscience. My path has been a vibrant blend of technology, science, and a relentless curiosity for what lies beyond the horizon.

My fascination with computers began in my early teens, building and configuring my own systems and home networks. They served as a playground that opened up endless possibilities and stilled my curiosity. Today, I work as an onsite IT technician, combining my background in cognitive neuroscience and years as a behavioral scientist, with a growing focus on IT and technology. I'm constantly expanding my skills with a vision to transition into a DevOps or Cloud Engineer role in near future.

Diving deeper into DevOps, Cloud, Infrastructure as code, cybersecurity and the broader tech landscape remains a continual source of excitement. Each new insight, each piece of knowledge, unlocks fresh opportunities and challenges.

When I’m not immersed in code or exploring the latest in tech, you'll find me on the Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu mat, in the gym or out hanging out with my kids and wife. Additionally, I love embracing the outdoors, where nature becomes my space for relaxation and adventure.

Through this blog, I hope to share my experiences, discoveries, and my ever-evolving quest to learn and explore. 

Thank you for joining me on this journey!
