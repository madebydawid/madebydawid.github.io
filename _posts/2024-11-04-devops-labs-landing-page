# DevOps Projects Overview

  

As part of my journey to deepen my understanding of DevOps and Cloud Engineering tools, I found a series of challenges at [Roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/devops/projects) that captured my curiosity.

This project lets me delve deeper into tools used by Cloud/DevOps Engineers and involve things like, CLI-scripting, automation, IaC, monitoring, docker and more.

  

A direct hands-on approach lets me challenge myself, it allows me explore technologies and satisfy my curiosity for problem-solving within these fields.

My long-term aim is to eventually transition from my current role as an IT technician to a Cloud Engineer position, thus making this project a valuable learning experience.

  

Here, Iâ€™ve outlined each project briefly, with links to detailed posts for those interested in learning more. And to my GitHub where the solutions are presented.

There will also be individual posts going into more detail about each tool/project and my thoughts, challenges and what I learned from each and one of them.

  

Enjoy! ðŸ˜Š
