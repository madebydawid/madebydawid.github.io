# Project 03/21
Analyzing logs is a critical part of managing web servers and ensuring their reliability. This project is all about creating a Bash-based Nginx Log Analyzer Tool to process, filter, and present meaningful insights from server logs.

This tool provides valuable data to help identify performance issues, traffic patterns, or suspicious activity, making it a vital asset for any DevOps workflow.

---

## Project Goal
The goal of this project is to help you practice some basic shell scripting skills. And to develop a tool that can:
- Parse Nginx log files efficiently.
- Extract relevant data, such as HTTP methods, response codes, IP addresses, or traffic volumes.
- Provide a summary of key metrics, such as request counts or error rates.
- Detect anomalies, like repeated failed login attempts, to flag potential security concerns.


## Requirements
To complete the project, the tool needed the following capabilities:

- Log Parsing: Handle large Nginx log files without performance issues.
- Customizable Filters: Allow filtering based on criteria like date ranges, IPs, or status codes.
- Output Format: Present the analysis in a readable format, such as tables or reports.
- Error Handling: Gracefully handle issues like missing or invalid log files.
- Automation: Optionally integrate with scheduling tools for periodic analysis.

## How to Use It
1. Clone the repository from my GitHub: Nginx Log Analyzer.
2. Navigate to the project directory and make the script executable:
```bash
chmod +x nginx-log-analyzer.sh
```

3. Run the script, providing the log file as an argument:
```bash
./nginx-log-analyzer.sh /path/to/nginx/access.log
```

4. Optionally, use the available flags for specific filters or summaries (documented in the README).
For automated log analysis, schedule the script using cron or similar tools.

## How did I approach the challenge?
Here‚Äôs how I tackled the project step by step:

- Understanding Nginx Logs: I reviewed the structure of Nginx access logs to identify key patterns and fields (e.g., IP, timestamp, request type).
- Scripting: Developed a Bash script using tools like awk, grep, and sort to extract and summarize log data.
- Testing: Used sample logs to test the script, ensuring it handled edge cases like malformed entries.
- Optimization: Refined the script for speed and added features like customizable filters.


## What did I Learn?
This project helped me enhance several technical skills:

Log Analysis üßæ: Learned how to efficiently process and analyze large log files.
Regex Mastery üîç: Used regular expressions to extract specific data fields.
Shell Scripting üìú: Improved my proficiency with tools like awk and grep.
Error Handling üõ†Ô∏è: Gained experience in making scripts more robust and user-friendly.
Automation ü§ñ: Explored ways to automate analysis tasks using cron.
