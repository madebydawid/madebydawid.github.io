# DevOps Projects Overview

Recently, I embarked on a journey to enhance my DevOps skills and practice the essential tools and techniques needed for a potential transition into Cloud Engineering or DevOps. While exploring online resources, I came across a series of challenges on Roadmap.sh that immediately sparked my interest. This long-term initiative is divided into 21 smaller (yet far from trivial) projects, starting with beginner-friendly tasks like Bash scripting and automation, progressing to intermediate-level topics such as Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and cloud technologies, and culminating in advanced areas like monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana, multi-service Docker deployments, and more.

This project offers me an opportunity to dive deep into the tools and methodologies commonly used by Cloud and DevOps Engineers. It covers a wide range of topics, including CLI scripting, automation, IaC, monitoring, Docker, and beyond.

Taking a hands-on approach allows me to challenge myself, explore new technologies, and indulge my passion for problem-solving in these domains.

My ultimate goal is to transition from my current role as an IT technician to a Cloud Engineer position, and this project serves as a stepping stone toward achieving that dream.

In this blog post, Iâ€™ve outlined each project briefly, with links to detailed write-ups for those who want to learn more. You can also find my GitHub repository, where I showcase the solutions, here.

Additionally, Iâ€™ll be publishing individual posts that delve deeper into each tool and project, sharing my thoughts, challenges, and key takeaways from every step of the journey.

Enjoy! ðŸ˜Š
